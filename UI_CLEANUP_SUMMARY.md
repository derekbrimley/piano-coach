# UI Cleanup Summary - Goals Tab Refactor

## Changes Made

### Overview
Removed the old 4-option "Practice Focus" selector and simplified the Goals tab to focus only on "Pieces I'm Learning". The overall practice goal system is now accessed separately from the Dashboard.

---

## What Was Removed

### ‚ùå Old "Practice Focus" Section
The Goals tab previously had a section with 4 clickable cards:
- Learning New Pieces
- Improving Technique
- Ear Training
- Expressivity

**This has been completely removed** because:
1. It was replaced by the new Practice Goal system (accessed from Dashboard)
2. The new system is more flexible and detailed
3. Technique and ear training should be tracked in the Profile page, not as "goals"

---

## What Remains

### ‚úÖ "Pieces I'm Learning" Section
This section is **kept intact** and is now the main focus of the Goals tab:
- Shows all pieces the user is currently working on
- Displays progress for traditional pieces (sections completed)
- Shows lead sheet progress checklist
- Allows adding, editing, and deleting pieces
- Last practiced date tracking
