# Practice Goal System Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I've successfully refactored the practice focus system from a simple 4-option selector to a comprehensive goal-based system. Here's what was implemented:

## 📋 Features Implemented

### 1. Data Model
- **New Types** (`src/types/index.ts`):
  - `PracticeGoal` interface with all required fields
  - `PracticeGoalType` enum with 7 goal types
  - `PracticeGoalStatus` enum (active, completed, abandoned)
  - Backwards compatibility maintained with deprecated `PracticeFocus`

### 2. Database Layer
- **New Hook** (`src/hooks/usePracticeGoal.ts`):
  - Real-time Firestore listener using `onSnapshot`
  - CRUD operations: `createGoal`, `updateGoal`, `completeGoal`, `abandonGoal`, `extendGoal`
  - Returns both current active goal and all goals history
  - One active goal per user (as specified)

### 3. User Interface

#### Dashboard Updates (`src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Displays current active goal prominently with:
  - Goal type and specific details
  - Days remaining counter
  - End date
  - Edit button
- Shows dashed border card when no goal is set
- **Expiration Warning**: Alert appears when goal has < 7 days remaining
- Quick actions: "Complete" or "Extend" buttons in warning

#### Goal Setup Flow (`src/components/PracticeGoalSetup.tsx`)
- Clean, simple form with:
  - Dropdown for goal type (7 options)
  - Optional textarea for specific details with contextual placeholders
  - Duration selector (1 week to 3 months, default 4 weeks)
  - Shows calculated end date
  - Save/Cancel actions
- Supports both creating new goals and editing existing ones

#### Session Start Message (`src/components/SessionStartMessage.tsx`)
- Shows at the start of each practice session
- Format: "Today's session supports your goal: [type] - [details]"
- Only appears when user has an active goal

### 4. LLM Integration

#### Updated Skill Summary (`src/utils/userSkillSummary.ts`)
- `generateUserSkillSummary()` now accepts optional `practiceGoal` parameter
- `formatSkillSummaryForLLM()` prioritizes goal information:
  - Shows goal type, specific details, timeline, dates
  - Calculates weeks remaining vs total weeks
  - Adds "IMPORTANT: Weight your practice session recommendations to support this goal"
  - Falls back to old `practiceFocus` if no goal exists

#### Session Generator (`src/components/SessionGenerator.tsx`)
- Integrated `usePracticeGoal` hook
- Passes practice goal to skill summary generator
- Shows `SessionStartMessage` component at top of session view

### 5. Routing & Navigation

#### App Routes (`src/App.tsx`)
- Added `/practice-goal` route
- Connected Dashboard's "Set Goal" button
- Integrated into existing navigation flow

### 6. Security

#### Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)
- Added `practiceGoals` collection rules
- Users can only read/write their own goals
- Standard user isolation pattern

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Backwards Compatibility
- Old `practiceFocus` system is marked DEPRECATED but still functional
- Code gracefully handles users without goals
- No breaking changes for existing users
- Gradual migration path available

### User Experience for Existing Users
1. User logs in → sees "No practice goal set" card on dashboard
2. Clicks "Set Goal" → fills out simple form
3. From then on, all sessions are tailored to their goal
4. Old practice focus ignored once goal is set

## 📊 Goal Lifecycle

### Creation
```
User → Dashboard → "Set Goal" button → PracticeGoalSetup form →
Goal created with status='active' → Dashboard shows goal
```

### During Active Period
```
Dashboard shows: [Goal type] [Details] [X days remaining]
Session Generator shows: "Today's session supports your goal..."
LLM receives: Structured goal information in prompt
```

### Approaching Expiration (< 7 days)
```
Dashboard shows warning alert with:
- "Your goal ends soon. Mark as complete or extend?"
- [Complete] button → status='completed'
- [Extend] button → endDate += 4 weeks
```

### After Goal Ends
```
User completes goal → Status changes to 'completed'
Dashboard shows: "No practice goal set" again
User can set new goal
```

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

1. **One Active Goal**: Keeps UI simple, can be expanded later
2. **4-Week Default**: Balances ambition with achievability
3. **Flexible Timeframe**: 1 week to 3 months accommodates different goals
4. **Optional Details**: Required type + optional specifics = flexibility
5. **Auto-Extend**: Extends by 4 weeks when user clicks extend
6. **Goal History**: All goals stored, even completed/abandoned
7. **LLM Priority**: Goal info comes FIRST in prompt for maximum impact

## ✨ What the User Sees

### First Time Flow
1. Opens app → sees "No practice goal set" card
2. Clicks "Set Goal"
3. Selects "Exam/Audition" from dropdown
4. Types "ABRSM Grade 8 in December"
5. Selects "12 weeks"
6. Clicks "Set Goal"
7. Returns to dashboard → sees beautiful goal card
8. Starts practice session → sees "Today's session supports your goal: Exam/Audition - ABRSM Grade 8 in December"

### Ongoing Use
- Dashboard always shows current goal prominently
- Each practice session references the goal
- LLM tailors exercises to support the goal
- Week before end date: warning appears
- Can complete or extend with one click

## 🔧 Testing Recommendations

Before deploying to production:

1. **Test Goal Creation**:
   - Create goal with all 7 types
   - Test with and without specific details
   - Try all duration options

2. **Test Goal Management**:
   - Edit existing goal
   - Complete a goal
   - Abandon a goal
   - Extend a goal

3. **Test Expiration Logic**:
   - Set a goal that ends in 5 days
   - Verify warning appears
   - Test extend and complete buttons

4. **Test LLM Integration**:
   - Generate session with different goal types
   - Verify prompt includes goal info
   - Check session activities align with goal

5. **Test Migration Path**:
   - Test with user who has old `practiceFocus`
   - Verify fallback works
   - Set new goal and verify it takes precedence

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Firestore Rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Deploy Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

3. **Optional: Run Migration Script** (see PRACTICE_GOAL_MIGRATION.md)

## 📈 Future Enhancements

The system is designed to easily support:
- Multiple concurrent goals
