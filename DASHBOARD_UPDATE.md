### Code Updates

**New Imports**:
```typescript
import { usePracticeGoal } from '../hooks/usePracticeGoal';
import type { PracticeGoal, PracticeGoalType } from '../types';
import LinearProgress from '@mui/joy/LinearProgress';
```

**Helper Functions Added**:
1. `getDaysRemaining(endDate)` - Calculates days until goal deadline
2. `getGoalProgress(goal)` - Returns progress text and percentage for each goal type

**Goal Type Labels**:
- Added `GOAL_TYPE_LABELS` constant for consistent naming
- Displays user-friendly names for each goal type

### Layout Structure

## User Experience Improvements

### At a Glance
Users can now immediately see:
- Which goals are active
- How much progress has been made
- How much time remains
- Which goals need attention (expiring soon)

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Goal title (most prominent)
2. Goal type (secondary)
3. Progress metrics (clear and quantitative)
4. Additional details (subtle, italic)

### Progress Indication
- **Percentage-based** goals show clear progress bars
- **Count-based** goals show clear metrics without bars
- **All goals** show time remaining prominently

### Color Psychology
- **Green**: Success, goal complete or on track
- **Blue**: Making progress
- **Orange**: Warning, needs attention
- **Red**: Urgent, deadline passed

## Technical Details

### Progress Calculation Logic

**Performance Goals**:
```typescript
percentage = (ready pieces / total pieces) * 100
```

**Specific Piece Goals**:
```typescript
percentage = (learned sections / total sections) * 100
```

**Exam Goals**:
```typescript
percentage = (completed requirements / total requirements) * 100
```

**Technique Goals**:
```typescript
percentage = (current BPM - starting BPM) / (target BPM - starting BPM) * 100
// Clamped between 0-100
```

### Loading States
- Shows loading spinner while fetching both sessions and goals
- Prevents layout shift with proper loading states
- Graceful handling of empty states

### Responsive Design
- Works on mobile (xs), tablet (sm), and desktop (md+)
- Cards stack on mobile
- Readable on all screen sizes

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Click-through to Goal Details
Add `onClick` handler to goal cards to navigate to detailed view:
```typescript
onClick={() => navigate(`/goals/${goal.id}`)}
```

### 2. Quick Actions on Goal Cards
Add inline buttons:
- "Update Progress"
- "View Details"
- "Mark Complete"

### 3. Progress Charts
Add visual charts for goals with historical data:
- BPM progress over time (line chart)
- Practice consistency (heatmap)
- Requirement completion (checklist view)

### 4. Goal Insights
- Suggestions based on progress
- Warnings for goals falling behind
- Celebration messages for milestones

### 5. Goal Sorting/Filtering
- Sort by deadline (closest first)
- Sort by progress (least complete first)
- Filter by goal type
