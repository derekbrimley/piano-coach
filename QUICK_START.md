# Practice Goal System - Quick Start Guide

## ‚ö° Deploy in 2 Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules (REQUIRED)

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

This adds security rules for the new `practiceGoals` collection. **Without this, you'll see permission errors.**

### Step 2: Test the Feature

1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
2. Log in to your app
3. You should see a card: **"No practice goal set"**
4. Click **"Set Goal"**
5. Select a goal type (e.g., "Performance/Recital")
6. Add optional details
7. Choose a timeframe
8. Click **"Set Goal"**
9. You're redirected to the dashboard with your goal displayed
10. Click **"Start Practice Session"**
11. See the message: **"Today's session supports your goal: [your goal]"**

## üéØ What You Built

The practice focus has been refactored from a simple 4-option selector to a comprehensive goal-based system:

**Before:**
- User selects: "learning new pieces", "ear training", "improving technique", or "expressivity"
- Stored as a single enum

**After:**
- User creates a detailed goal with:
  - Goal type (7 options including Performance, Exam, Sight-Reading, etc.)
  - Optional specific details (free text)
  - Start and end dates (1 week to 3 months)
  - Status tracking (active/completed/abandoned)
- Dashboard shows goal prominently with days remaining
- LLM receives structured goal information in the prompt
- Expiration warnings and quick extend/complete actions
